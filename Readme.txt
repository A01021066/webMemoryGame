This is a memory game.

Upon entering the game, player will be given a 5x5 board where 3 of the tiles are correct tiles.The correct tiles will then be flipped over and shown to player. After about 5 seconds, the correct tiles flips back, and the entire game board rotates for 90 degree. Player will then need to find all of the correct tiles in order to advance in the game.

Player will be granted 1 score for each correct tile found. Player will also lose 1 score for each of the incorrect tiles clicked on. Once the score goes below 0, game ends. Alternatively, if the player finds the state of the game too challenging and want to reserve the current score, player can click on the terminate button to end the game.

Game board is reseted after player found all of the correct tiles on the board, at that point, if the player found all of the correct tiles without making a single mistake, the game will increase in difficulty, adding an extra row/column of tile, as well as incrementing the number of correct tiles needed to be found for the next roung. On the otherhand, if player made mistakes while finishing this round, the game will balance the difficulty by reinstantiating the same sized board with one less correct tile needed to be found.

The minimum size of the board is 5x5, and the minimum correct tiles is set to 3.

--- IMPORTANT --- 
To prevent passive gameplay, the score used for ranking will be the [final score] * [highest tile target achieved].

e.g. if a player ended a game with 3 score and 3 tiles, but he is at 3 tiles after reaching 4 tiles in the last round, his score for ranking will still be 3*4=12 instead of 3*3=9
I think this somewhat encourages players to keep on trying/playing even if they are not 100% sure about the current round. Because they can get the score back the next round.
--- IMPORTANT ---

Upon ending the game, player will be prompted to enter user name for submitting the score to leaderboard. Once submitted, player can view the top 5 rankings on leader board, as well as a message telling the player what ranking was his/her score on the overall ranking. At anypoint during this, if the player wants to start another round, simply hit the restart button.

For testing and marking purpose, I made a cheat mode where the correct tiles are highlighted even after flipping, should the player wish to turn it off, simply click off the check box.
