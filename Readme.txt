This is a memory game.

Upon entering the game, player will be given a 5x5 board where 3 of the tiles are correct tiles.The correct tiles will then be flipped over and shown to player. After about 5 seconds, the correct tiles flips back, and the entire game board rotates for 90 degree. Player will then need to find all of the correct tiles in order to advance in the game.

Player will be granted 1 score for each correct tile found. Player will also lose 1 score for each of the incorrect tiles clicked on. Once the score goes below 0, game ends. Alternatively, if the player finds the state of the game too challenging and want to reserve the current score, player can click on the terminate button to end the game.

Game board is reseted after player found all of the correct tiles on the board, at that point, if the player found all of the correct tiles without making a single mistake, the game will increase in difficulty, adding an extra row/column of tile, as well as incrementing the number of correct tiles needed to be found for the next roung. On the otherhand, if player made mistakes while finishing this round, the game will balance the difficulty by reinstantiating the same sized board with one less correct tile needed to be found.

The minimum size of the board is 5x5, and the minimum correct tiles is set to 3.
